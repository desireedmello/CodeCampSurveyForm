<h1 align="center"> freeCodeCamp Survey Form (My Attempt) </h1>

<p>
  I have tried to replicate the freeCodeCamp Survey Form using html for creating the main form details and css for desiging the form. The link to the actual survey form from freeCodeCamp is (http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html). I would love to hear your feedback if my attempt at replicating their form was a success :smiley:
